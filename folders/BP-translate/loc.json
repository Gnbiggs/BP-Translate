She is the princess of the Bafarian tribe. It is said that the \"God\" who once built an advanced civilization and gave birth to humans still lives beyond the sky. They direct the Order of Bafalia through oracles and retrieve engrams from the Abaritia sealed away in the Holy Land. However, as a result, the distortion caused by Abaritia accumulated, leading to the destruction of the planet. Erinze wanted to release this cause and effect and explore a new future. Although it was only for a short time, Erinze told me that the trip with them was \"fun\". There was a faint glint in Feste's eyes when he heard that. At the Chronogate on the top floor, Bachelard was waiting. The face was familiar. The man I saw in my dream--the man who took the screaming boy's mother away. As soon as Bachelard glanced at us, he attacked without saying a word. Tiris is also beaten away, and Erinze is put into a coma. And Bachelard took only Erinze and made a chronoleap. A voice from Imagineseed was heard in the place left behind. \"Help Erinze\" \"She will be used in the 'plan'\" The voice does not answer the question. However, Erinze cannot be left alone. It is said that Charlotte will open the way to the future. Let's hurry to the Kaltoum Ruins to meet her."},{"id":40,"text":"\u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7 In addition to Charlotte and Carvein, Einlein and York were also present in the Cartoum ruins. It seems that an oracle was sent to Einlein and that he was waiting here. Charlotte followed the oracle and entrusted me with the pendant. Inside was a chronogram of high purity that even Tiris was surprised by. It is said that even if everyone chrono-leaps, it still has more power. With this, I can rescue Erinze. After thanking Charlotte and the others, we decided to head to the future from the ``Kamikake no Mihashira''."},{"id":41,"text":"\u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7 I could see the laboratory where the Avalitya Shell was installed. Already at the final stage, a black haze began to grow from Avalitya Shell to Erinze with Bachelard's signal. Tiris jumped in and rescued Erinze in the nick of time. However, this time Tiris is caught by Avalitya Shell. An alarm rang out, and Bashlar gave instructions, but the movement of the Avalitya Shell did not stop. Unable to reach Tilith's outstretched hand, she was swallowed by the Avalitya Shell. The next moment, Abaritia Shell emitted a dazzling light and disappeared without a trace. According to Bachelard, Avalitya Shell jumped from here 1000 years ago to their own era. Moreover, the space-time is disturbed by its influence, and it is not possible to chrono-leap and chase it. In the stalemate, Merlouf came along with Hrelbe. After understanding all the circumstances, he said, \"I'll make it possible for Chronoleap.\" Half in doubt, I headed for Chronogate, and indeed the space-time was stable. Chrono Leap is possible with this. Bachelard has proposed a cooperative relationship with the goal of capturing the Abaritia Shell. Erinze seemed emotionally unwilling to nod, but she gave priority to saving Tiris and accepted the proposal. Bachelard's support, such as the preparation of the chronogram, was essential for the rescue of Tiris. Leaving Hrelbe on guard, I performed Chronoleap with Erinze again. Our destination is our time. We must find Avalitya Shell and Tiris, who should be there."},{"id":42,"text":"\u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7 I found Merlouf by asking people in town. About half a year ago, Merlouf sensed an abnormal outbreak of engrams in the Basilica of Blessed Blessings, located underground on St. Bafalia Island. Probably from Avalitya Shell. According to Ehrinze, the Avalitya Shell jumps through time and space without using chronograms. Because of that, it is thought that the times have shifted and history has changed in half a year. The Temple of Blessings is an important base of the Bafarian religion. The only way to get there is via the Temple of Asterries. I don't know if I'll get permission, but let's go to the temple anyway."},{"id":43,"text":"\u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7 \u25c7 Discovered the Avalitya Shell in the deepest part of the \"Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings\". Einlein put up a barrier and confined Avalitya Shell. This will prevent it from moving around on its own. Tiris is sleeping half-buried in the Avalitya Shell. We have not yet reached full integration. However, someday Avalitya Shell will wake up and take in Tiris. Before that, we must find a way to isolate Tirith. Otherwise, the world will face the future of destruction. If there was no way to save Tiris\u2014if there was no way to avoid future destruction\u2014what would you do?

As I accompanied him, Hrelbe told me about Bachelard's plans. It is the \"Abaritia Shell Project\". The idea was to fuse Erinze with a special \"Abaritia Shell\" to control other Abaritia. Of course, there were many opposing opinions, and in the end it was decided that Erinze would release Avalitya. However, even that was Bachelard's speculation. As a result of releasing Abaritia and activating the biometric engram, Erinze was in a state where it was easier to fuse with the Abaritia shell. The fusion of Erinze and Avalitya Shell is still underway.

It wasn't to control Abaritia. The real purpose is to destroy the overdeveloped civilization, the \"Beast of the Planet\". Controlling a beast that exists in the imaginary world, not in a fairy tale, was the entirety of the Avalitya Shell Project. In order to protect the planet and civilization, Bachelard tells him that Erinze's sacrifice is unavoidable. However, Tiris does not accept that, and clearly says, \"I want to help Erinze.\" The soldiers sent by Bachelar were taken over by Hrelbe.

The King must have been sick and recuperating. There is no fact that he was assassinated in a dragon attack incident, and of course there is no way Carvain would assassinate him.
