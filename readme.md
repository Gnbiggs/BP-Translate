Copy the folder to your C Drive and make sure that it is named: "BP-Translate".

Next right clicking "BPTranslatorInstall.bat" and running as administrator.

A popup box will appear asking you to enter the BandiNamcoLauncherGames folder path, as an example mine is:

C:\BandaiNamcoLauncherGames

If the above is your folder path, just click on OK and it will use the above path as default.

The script will then install the applications.

A second input box will appear. You will be required to enter the folder path of where Bandi Namco Launcher is stored, as an example mine is:

C:\Program Files (x86)\BandaiNamcoLauncher

Again, if your folder path is currently located in the path above, just click okay and it should launch the Launcher.

Once all the files are in the correct location BP-Translate will run, then the game will run. Do not move the mouse as the game will automatically start from the Bandai Namco Launcher, it may take around 30 seconds to start.

This has been ran an tested but can't be guarenteed it will work for everyone due to the folder path locations. I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Any problems you can reach out to me.
